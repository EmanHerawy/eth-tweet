Decentralized Twitter
=====================

This repository contains the code of a decentralized microblogging service running on the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org) blockchain.

The service provides basic Twitter-like functionality to tweet messages of up to 160 characters.

Here, `decentralization` means there is no company or central authority in control of what is being published.


The system is `censorship resistant` in the sense that once a message is published, it can only be removed by the publisher.

All accounts can receive `donations` in Ethereum's Ether crypto currency. Being able to receive donations can be an incentive to run a decentralized microblogging feed.

To not expose the user's social graph to the world, following other accounts is not supported on purpose.
